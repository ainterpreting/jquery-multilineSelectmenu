# jquery-multilineSelectmenu
This is a jQuery UI extension that adds multiline and css styling support to selectmenu options.

# Usage
Create a selectmenu as normal using <select> and <options>

Then turn it into a widget by doing $( selection ).multilineSelectmenu();

CSS styling can be applied to the ui-selectmenu-menu-item-header and the ui-selectmenu-menu-item-content classes.
